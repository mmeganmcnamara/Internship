# Internship
Projects worked on during my 8 week UX UI internship in Rome, Italy at IperDesign for Summer 2024.

Skills include: 
* D3.JS
* Three.JS
* Web Audio API
* Web Speech API's Speech Synthesis
* SCSS
* JQuery

During my time, I worked on creating a dynamic informational animation to display information regarding IperDesign and its parent companies as part of the "Newton Universe". Clickable images rotated around the main logo, pausing on hover and turning greyscale off.
I also worked on creating an audio visualizer for text-to-speech from an AI chatbot. Different variations of this included using D3.JS and Three.JS.
